# Unit Testing Framework

This is a simple example of using TestNG to test a simple class contained in a JAR file with tests pre-conditions and post-conditions implemented with appropriate annotations.

## Requirements
- Write unit tests for Calculator-1.0.jar
- Write tests using any testing framework (JUnit or TestNG)
- Each class should test only one method of the library
- Tests pre-conditions and post-conditions should be implemented with appropriate annotations
- **For TestNG only**: create `.xml` configuration file and use it to run tests. Create at least one test group. Some tests can depend on this group, or this group can be used to exclude/include tests from launch using XML-suite;
- Create parametrized tests (data-driven approach);
- Configure and execute tests in parallel mode.

## Acceptance criteria
- A separate Unit Test class exists for each method of the Jar class file.
- JUnit or TestNG is used in home task.
- Tests have pre-conditions and post-conditions.
- Screenshots with results of running in IDE are available.
- **For TestNG only**: `Xml` configuration exists for suite. This configuration allows use/run group of tests;
    - Data-driven approach is demonstrated with test framework features
    - Parallel execution of tests is demonstrated with test framework features.
